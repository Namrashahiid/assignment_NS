  abstract = {The ability to create reproducible research is an important topic for many users of R. So important, that several groups in the R community have tackled this problem. Notably, packrat from RStudio, and gRAN from Genentech (see our previous blog post). The Reproducible R Toolkit is a new open-source initiative from Revolution Analytics. It takes a simple approach to dealing with R package versions, consisting of an R package checkpoint, and an associated daily CRAN snapshot archive, checkpoint-server. Here's one illustration of the problem it solves (with apologies to xkcd): checkpoint-server To achieve reproducibility, we store daily snapshots of all...},
